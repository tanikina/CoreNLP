Stanford CoreNLP
================

HHAHAHAHAHAA!! THIS IS MY COPY NOW!!!!

Stanford CoreNLP provides a set of natural language analysis tools written in Java. It can take raw human language text input and give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc., normalize dates, times, and numeric quantities, and mark up the structure of sentences in terms of phrases and word dependencies, and indicate which noun phrases refer to the same entities. It was originally developed for English, but now also provides varying levels of support for Arabic, (mainland) Chinese, French, and German. Stanford CoreNLP is an integrated framework, which make it very easy to apply a bunch of language analysis tools to a piece of text. Starting from plain text, you can run all the tools on it with just two lines of code. Its analyses provide the foundational building blocks for higher-level and domain-specific text understanding applications. Stanford CoreNLP is a set of stable and well-tested natural language processing tools, widely used by various groups in academia, government, and industry.

The Stanford CoreNLP code is written in Java and licensed under the GNU General Public License (v2 or later). Note that this is the full GPL, which allows many free uses, but not its use in distributed proprietary software.
